This is a very basic python webscraper which I put together today. I've not learnt python before, but I am a professional software developer while I attend university. I am proficient in Java, SQL (especially PostgreSQL) and Typescript/Javascript. I am highly motivated to learn and have enjoyed spending these hours learning the basics of python and putting together this little program.

The program can be run using python3, and should try to install the required packages automatically.

The program allows a user to view the top ~50 headlines from the BBC website and select an article to read in-depth by scraping the BBC.com homepage using BeautifulSoup and the Requests library.
